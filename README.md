## üéØ Overview

Z Lottery is a revolutionary blockchain-based lottery system that leverages Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to create a provably fair, transparent, and privacy-preserving gaming experience. Unlike traditional lotteries that rely on trusted third parties or centralized random number generators, Z Lottery uses cryptographic encryption to ensure that lottery numbers remain confidential until they are revealed, preventing any possibility of manipulation.

Each lottery ticket is an ERC721 NFT containing an encrypted random number. Players can "scratch" their tickets to request decryption through Zama's oracle network, revealing whether they've won. The winning condition is simple: all four digits of the revealed number must be identical (e.g., 0000, 1111, 2222, ..., 9999).

### Why Z Lottery?

- **True Randomness**: Cryptographically secure random number generation using blockchain properties
- **Privacy-First**: Numbers remain encrypted until scratched, ensuring no one can peek at results
- **Provably Fair**: All lottery logic is transparent and verifiable on-chain
- **No Intermediaries**: Smart contracts handle everything automatically
- **NFT Ownership**: Tickets are tradeable ERC721 tokens

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üé´ NFT-Based Tickets
- Each lottery ticket is an ERC721 NFT
- Fully transferable and tradeable
- Persistent ownership record on-chain
- Custom metadata and token URI support

### üîê Fully Homomorphic Encryption
- Random numbers encrypted using Zama's FHEVM
- Numbers remain confidential until player requests reveal
- Computations performed on encrypted data
- Oracle-based decryption for transparency

### üé≤ Fair Random Number Generation
- Uses blockchain properties for randomness
- Combines multiple entropy sources: `block.prevrandao`, blockhash, buyer address, token ID
- 4-digit numbers (0000-9999) with modulo operation
- Deterministic yet unpredictable

### üí∞ Automated Prize Distribution
- Instant prize payouts for winners (when contract has sufficient balance)
- Deferred prize system when funds are temporarily insufficient
- Prize claiming mechanism for pending rewards
- Transparent prize tracking

### üîÑ Scratch-Off Mechanism
- Players trigger decryption by "scratching" tickets
- Asynchronous reveal process via oracle
- Event-driven architecture for transparency
- Request ID tracking for debugging

### üìä Complete Ticket Lifecycle
1. **Purchase**: Pay 0.001 ETH to mint a ticket NFT
2. **Hold**: Ticket contains encrypted number
3. **Scratch**: Request decryption to reveal number
4. **Reveal**: Oracle decrypts and checks for winners
5. **Claim**: Automatic or manual prize claiming

## üîÑ How It Works

### Step 1: Buying a Ticket

```solidity
function buyTicket() external payable returns (uint256 tokenId)
```

1. Player sends exactly 0.001 ETH to the contract
2. Contract mints a new ERC721 NFT to the player
3. A random 4-digit number (0000-9999) is generated using:
   - `block.prevrandao` (Ethereum's randomness beacon)
   - Previous block hash
   - Buyer's address
   - Token ID
   - Contract address
4. The number is encrypted using FHE and stored on-chain
5. Ticket metadata initialized with default state

### Step 2: Scratching the Ticket

```solidity
function scratchTicket(uint256 tokenId) external
```

1. Ticket owner calls `scratchTicket()`
2. Contract validates ownership and ticket state
3. Decryption request sent to Zama Oracle
4. Request ID stored for tracking
5. Ticket marked as "scratch requested"

### Step 3: Oracle Fulfillment

```solidity
function fulfillScratch(uint256 requestId, bytes calldata cleartexts, bytes calldata decryptionProof) external
```

1. Zama Oracle decrypts the encrypted number off-chain
2. Oracle calls `fulfillScratch()` with decrypted result
3. Contract verifies oracle's signature
4. Revealed number stored on-chain
5. Winning logic executed: checks if all 4 digits are identical
6. If winner, automated prize distribution triggered
7. Events emitted for transparency

### Step 4: Prize Distribution

```solidity
function _handlePrize(uint256 tokenId, address recipient) private
```

- **Sufficient Balance**: Prize (0.01 ETH) sent immediately
- **Insufficient Balance**: Prize marked as pending, can be claimed later
- `PrizePaid` or `PrizePending` event emitted

### Winning Condition

A ticket wins if all four digits of the revealed number are identical:

```solidity
function _isWinningNumber(uint32 number) private pure returns (bool) {
    uint32 thousands = number / 1000;
    uint32 hundreds = (number / 100) % 10;
    uint32 tens = (number / 10) % 10;
    uint32 units = number % 10;
    return thousands == hundreds && hundreds == tens && tens == units;
}
```

**Winning Numbers**: 0000, 1111, 2222, 3333, 4444, 5555, 6666, 7777, 8888, 9999

**Winning Probability**: 10 / 10,000 = 0.1% (1 in 1,000)

## üéØ Problems Solved

### Problem 1: Lack of Trust in Traditional Lotteries
**Traditional Issue**: Players must trust lottery operators to conduct fair drawings and pay out prizes honestly.

**Zama Solution**: All lottery logic is encoded in immutable smart contracts. Winning conditions are transparent, and prize payouts are automatic. No human intervention possible.

### Problem 2: Centralized Random Number Generation
**Traditional Issue**: Random numbers generated by centralized services can potentially be manipulated or predicted.

**Zama Solution**: Random numbers generated using blockchain-native entropy sources (block randomness, hashes) combined with player-specific data. Result is encrypted immediately, preventing any tampering.

### Problem 3: Privacy Concerns
**Traditional Issue**: Traditional blockchain lotteries expose all numbers publicly, potentially enabling statistical attacks or pattern recognition.

**Zama Solution**: FHE keeps numbers encrypted until player chooses to reveal. Even contract owner cannot peek at unrevealed tickets.

### Problem 4: Complex Prize Distribution
**Traditional Issue**: Manual prize claims require user action, can be lost or forgotten, and involve high gas costs for bulk distributions.

**Zama Solution**: Automatic prize distribution upon ticket reveal. Pending prizes can be claimed anytime. Efficient single-transaction payouts.

### Problem 5: Regulatory Compliance
**Traditional Issue**: Many jurisdictions require lottery transparency and fairness guarantees.

**Zama Solution**: Complete audit trail on-chain. Provably fair algorithms. Transparent prize pools. Open-source code available for regulatory review.

### Problem 6: High Operational Costs
**Traditional Issue**: Traditional lotteries require extensive infrastructure, staff, and overhead.

**Zama Solution**: Fully automated smart contract system. No operational costs beyond blockchain gas fees. Self-sustaining prize pool model.

### Problem 7: Lack of Composability
**Traditional Issue**: Traditional lottery systems are siloed and cannot integrate with other platforms.

**Zama Solution**: ERC721 standard enables integration with entire Ethereum ecosystem. Tickets tradeable on any NFT marketplace. Compatible with DeFi protocols.

- **Tamper-Proof**: Cannot modify encrypted values without detection

#### Random Number Generation
- Multiple entropy sources combined
- Block randomness via `prevrandao`
- Player-specific salt
- Modulo operation for uniform distribution

### Smart Contract Security

#### Access Control
- Owner-only administrative functions
- Oracle-only callback functions
- Ticket owner-only operations
- Reentrancy guards on prize payouts

#### Edge Cases Handled
- Insufficient balance for prizes ‚Üí Deferred claiming
- Oracle timeout/failure ‚Üí Can re-request scratch
- Duplicate scratch requests ‚Üí Rejected
- Invalid token IDs ‚Üí Proper error handling

#### Gas Optimization
- Efficient storage layout
- Minimal state changes
- Batch operation support (future)
- View function caching

### Operational Security

#### Owner Responsibilities
- Secure private key management
- Multi-sig wallet recommended
- Regular contract funding
- Oracle address updates

#### Oracle Trust Assumptions
- Relies on Zama Oracle for decryption
- Signature verification for proof
- Fallback mechanisms planned (future)
- Oracle address update capability

### Audit Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **This contract has not been audited yet.** Use at your own risk.

**Recommended before mainnet:**
- Professional smart contract audit
- Formal verification of lottery logic
- Penetration testing
- Economic attack analysis

### Known Limitations

1. **Oracle Dependency**: Contract relies on Zama Oracle for reveals
2. **Pending Prizes**: Winners may need to claim if balance is low
3. **Gas Costs**: Scratch operation requires oracle callback gas
4. **Winning Odds**: Fixed at 0.1% (10/10,000)

### Best Practices for Users

- ‚úÖ Only use testnet ETH for testing
- ‚úÖ Verify contract address before interaction
- ‚úÖ Keep track of your ticket NFTs
- ‚úÖ Claim prizes promptly
- ‚úÖ Use hardware wallet for large amounts
- ‚ùå Don't share private keys
- ‚ùå Don't scratch tickets you don't own
- ‚ùå Don't send ETH directly without using buyTicket()
